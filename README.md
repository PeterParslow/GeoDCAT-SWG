# OGC GeoDCAT SWG

The purpose of this SWG is to revise, publish, and maintain GeoDCAT, a spatio-temporal profile of the W3C DCAT Recommendation [DCAT](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/), and provide guidance about its use and further specialization.

The GeoDCAT profile of DCAT will be implemented as both human and machine-actionable resources.
