# OGC GeoDCAT SWG

The purpose of this SWG is to revise, publish, and maintain GeoDCAT, a spatio-temporal profile of the W3C DCAT Recommendation [DCAT](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/), and provide guidance about its use and further specialization.

This profile is inspired by the GeoDCAT-AP specification but defines just the internationally relevant concepts to allow wider application. The key areas to consider are around the expression of place and time, such as [GeoDCAT-AP properties-for-location](https://semiceu.github.io/GeoDCAT-AP/releases/#properties-for-location).

The GeoDCAT profile of DCAT will be implemented as both human and machine-actionable resources.

Implementations and test cases will be linked or included as sub-modules of this repository to partition governance and access of the core standard from the technical work to test implementations. For example an [OGCAPI-Records based implementation](https://github.com/ogcincubator/geodcat-ogcapi-records/blob/master/README.md) will be supported as part of related work and is open to community input.

The [GeoDCAT Standards Working Group (SWG)](https://portal.ogc.org/?m=projects&a=view&project_id=713) (login required) is the group at OGC responsible for the stewardship of the standard, but is working to do as much work in public as possible.

It is required that the standard is supported by implementation evidence, so proposals and issues should preferably be made with reference to an implementation and outcomes of regression tests for any test cases defined for the standard.

Pull Requests from contributors are welcomed. However, please note that by sending a Pull Request or Commit to this GitHub repository, you are agreeing to the terms in the Observer Agreement https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=92169
